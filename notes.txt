Code for simulation and analysis of selfish mtDNA dynamics, and links with G-quadruplexes in control region

sim/ -- RTS simulation of selfish mtDNA dynamics
  mtdna-mito.c -- simulates RTS model with mito-level selection. command-line argument determines whether parameter space is spanned (0) or a zoomed-in region is investigated (1)
  mtdna-cell.c -- simulates RTS model with cell-level selection (SI of article)

  plot-rts.sh -- plots output of mtdna-mito.c (1) in Gnuplot
  plot-si-rts-trellis.sh -- plots output of mtdna-mito.c (0) in Gnuplot
  plot-si-cell-trellis.sh -- plots output of mtdna-cell.c in Gnuplot
  plot-si-rts-time-series.sh -- plots time series output of mtdna-mito.c (0) in Gnuplot
  
bioinf/ -- analyses G-quad regions in sequences from NCBI and Kang et al. papers
  rcrs.txt -- data file containing revised Cambridge reference sequence (RCRS)
  edits.ods -- data file containing differences between Kang et al. sequences and RCRC. Taken directly from the SI of Kang et al. 2019.
  database.txt -- data file containing haplogroups and haplotypes for a set of NCBI accessions
  [reconstruct-sequences.nb] -- Mathematica file using edits.ods and rcrs.txt to reconstruct sequences from Kang et al. paper into FASTA format
  kang-fasta.fasta -- data file, output from the above
  [mtdna-sequences.fasta] -- data file, not included in repository due to size, containing mtDNA sequences in FASTA format from NCBI
  
  find-gquads.c -- identifies and scores potential G-quadruplex sequences at particular regions in all sequences in a given FASTA file. run this on kang-fasta.fasta and mtdna-sequences.fasta to provide output for the following analyses.
  
  kang-competition.R -- reads output of the above, compares logistic regression models, and calculates predictive power of simple model
  plot-kang-data.sh -- plots inferred relationship and mtDNA statistics

  process-ncbi.sh -- rearranges and organises output of find-gquads.c for processing
  make-ps.c -- produces PostScript figure from these data (SI of article)
